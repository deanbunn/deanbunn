### My Background

My IT career started back in the late 90's when I joined the Army. My MOS \(military occupational skill\) was in mobile communications. Upon leaving the Army, I worked as a contractor for WorldCom configuring remote circuit connections. In 2003, I landed a job as temp at UC Davis. From there things took off and in a few years, I became a system admin with developer duties assigned. Currently, I'm an application developer on the DevOps team for the College of Engineering.
